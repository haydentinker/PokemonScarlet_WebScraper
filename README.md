# PokemonScarlet_WebScraper

Webscrapper that gets Pokemon Scarlet/Violet pokedex information from the internet.

#Motivation
I have always been a big fan of the Pokemon franchise and I love completing the Pokedex in each game. However, this becomes a big chore when I have to constantly research where to get each Pokemon. This program seeks to make that easier by allowing you input Pokedex numbers and giving you the location of the Pokemon.
